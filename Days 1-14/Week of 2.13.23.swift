This goes over
multiple lines

//-------COMPLEX DATATYPES--------
/*||Arrays||
- autimatically adapts to size
- only one type of data
- type safety - can't add arr of strings with string of ints
- must initialize with type or values*/
let temps = [67.9, 54.8, 43.9]
var scores = Array<Int>() //let scores = [Int]()
scores.append(90)
scores.append(78)
print(scores.count)

scores.append(76)
scores.contains(8)
scores.sort()
let presidents = ["Bush", "Obama", "Trump", "Biden"]
let reversedPresidents = presidents.reversed()
print(reversedPresidents) //doesn't actually reverse, remember they are reversed for accessing

/*||Dictionaries||
- can use any type for key and value, but all keys need to be same and all values should have same type
- can't have duplicate keys - overwrite
- .count() and .removeAll*/
var employee = [
    "name": "Bob",
    "job": "teacher",
    "location": "Atlanta"
]
print(employee["name"]!) //prints optional because that key may or may not exist
print(employee["name", default:"unknown"]) //always get a string back
var heights = [String: Int]() //initialize dictionry
employee["job"] = "lawyer"
print(employee)

/*||Sets||
- don't remember order
- don't add duplicates
- advantage: when you don't want duplicates, highly optimized for searching by using .contains(), can sort a set using .sorted() - will return array
- will probably use arrays most times, but sometimes sets are useful
- */
var people = Set(["Denzel Washington", "Tom Cruise", "Nicolas Cage", "Samuel L Jackson"])
print(people) //will print in any order - different every time
people.insert("Jennifer Lawrence") //don't append because no order

/*||Enums||
- short for enumeration
- named values
- prevents changing a var to something not in the possible choices
- highly optimized - Swift stores each case as number
- value of enums have the same type annotation as the enum itself*/
enum Weekday {
    case monday, tuesday, wednesday, thursday, friday
} //no longer can make Weekday anything other than these
var day = Weekday.monday
//or write it like this
var newDay = Weekday.tuesday
newDay = .thursday

/*||Type Annotations||
 - usually Swift infers the type
 - explitly define type instead - String, Int, Bool, Double
 - not required, but if you want an empty array or other data type
 - used for constants ("let" values) that haven't been decided yet - knows not to used constant before intialized
 - Swift must know at all times what type all data is
 - can't do var scored: Int = "Zero"*/

var user: [String: String] = ["id" : "@bob123"]  //dictionary with string key and value

//choose any of these for syntax to create empty array
var teams: [String] = [String]()
var cities: [String] = []

/*||Checkpoint 2||
 - create array of strings, print items and count duplicates*/
